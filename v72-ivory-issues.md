# Ivory Theme Issues

## What I See
- Background IS light (cream/off-white) — the theme IS applying
- Sidebar IS light with dark text — working
- The greeting "Good afternoon, Junaid" text is dark — readable
- Quick Stats cards have colored backgrounds but look washed out — the colored icon circles look odd against light bg
- Meeting cards have light backgrounds — working
- The overall feel is "light mode" but some elements look washed out or have poor contrast
- The stat card icons (colored circles) look out of place on the light background
- The "Strategic Insights" and "Quick Stats" sections need better contrast
- The hero section gradient doesn't adapt well to light mode

## Key Issues to Fix
1. Stat card icon backgrounds need better contrast on light bg
2. Some text is hard to read (low contrast)
3. The hero gradient needs to be inverted for light mode
4. Meeting cards need borders/shadows for definition on light bg
5. The overall "washed out" feel needs more contrast and definition
