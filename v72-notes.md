## v72 Theme Testing - Round 2

### Midnight Theme - WORKING!
The Midnight theme is now clearly visible and distinct:
- Background has a noticeable dark navy blue tint
- Cards have a lighter navy blue background
- The Quick Stats section shows distinct blue-tinted cards
- The sidebar has a deep navy tone
- The Unread Emails section cards are clearly blue-tinted
- The greeting hero section has a navy gradient
- This is CLEARLY different from Obsidian (pure black)

### Slate Theme - WORKING!
The Slate theme has a warm brown/amber tint visible across the page. The sidebar has a warm brownish tone, the cards have a warm tint, and the accent is amber/orange. The border colors have a warm cast. Clearly different from Obsidian and Midnight.
