# Ivory Theme Test - After Fix

## Current State
- The page is still showing DARK background with green accent (Emerald theme was last selected)
- The Ivory theme was not re-selected after the code change
- Need to switch to Ivory to test the fixed palette inversion

## What I See
- Sidebar: dark background, green accent on Command Center
- Main content: dark background, loading spinner
- The Emerald theme IS working - green accent visible
- Need to navigate to Settings > Appearance and click Ivory to test the fix
